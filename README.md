 We are making a counter interface system for a bakery. The cashier can enter the items, their quantity and price and then use the algorithm to sell and compute bills for customers. Project uses a BST to store the menu items and their prices and quantity. It uses a queue to compute the bill for a customer and also to store the items bought by the customer. The items to be bought are selected from the BST and their count is decreased by 1 in the quantity and then that item is pushed into the queue. After the cashier computes the bill, the queue is all popped and is empty to be inputted for the next customer. The total variable used in the bill compute function is also restored to a value of 0.
